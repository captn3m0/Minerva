Minerva is a simple ebook scanning system, which uses amazon's Product Search API along with google book search to generate metadata for each book.

The data is stored using [RedBeans][1], which includes support for mysql,postgre and sqlite.

The entire script is written using PHP.

This could be useful in instances where you need to scan ebooks and generate metadata (for eg custom Lucene engines)

Also uses the [cloudfusion Product Advertising API][2] for amazon.

##Instructions
* Run ''git submodule update'' to get the amazon apis
* Set configuration settings in config.php
* Run ./indexer.php
